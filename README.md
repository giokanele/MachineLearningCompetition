Code for the 2023 Engineering Physics machine learning competition for our team, Gio and Armaan. The goal was to control a car inside of a driving simulation and collect the license plates of parked cars. 
A mixture of image processing and imitiation learning was used to control the navigation of the car. Meanwhile, a Convolutional Neural Netork (CNN)
was used to identify license plates.

The code is majority python, using libraries such as openCV, tensorflow (specifically Keras), numpy and others.
